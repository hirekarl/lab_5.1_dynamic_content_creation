## Assignment
### Lab Overview
In this lab, you will create a dynamic shopping cart application to practice and reinforce your DOM manipulation skills. The application will allow users to add, update, and remove items dynamically while keeping track of the total price. This lab focuses on modifying elements, creating and appending new elements, and updating content dynamically using JavaScript.

### Workplace Context
Imagine you are tasked with building the shopping cart feature for an e-commerce website. Customers should be able to:
1. Add items to their cart dynamically.
2. View the items they have added, along with their prices and quantities.
3. Update the quantity of items in the cart, reflecting real-time price changes.
4. Remove items from the cart.

This lab will help you simulate and build core functionality used in modern e-commerce applications.

### Activity Tasks
#### 1. Add Products
- Test adding products with different names and prices.
- Ensure each product appears in the list with the correct price.

#### 2. Remove Products
- Test removing products from the cart.
- Verify that the total price updates accurately after removing items.

#### 3. Edge Cases
- Attempt to add products with empty names or invalid prices and ensure the application handles these cases gracefully.

#### 4. Enhance the App (Optional):
- Allow users to update the quantity of products in the cart and recalculate the total price.
